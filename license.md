# API Copyleft License

## Purpose

<!-- See https://writing.kemitchell.com/2019/01/10/Discipline-Stated-Purpose.html -->

This license gives you permission to use, share, and build with this software for free, but requires you to contribute source code for changes, additions, and software that you build with it, other than prototypes and applications.

<!-- Compare Parity, which does not make any permissive allowance for applications integrating the software being licensed: "This license lets you use and share this software for free, as long as you contribute software you make with it." -->

## Acceptance

In order to receive this license, you must agree to its rules.  The rules of this license are both obligations under that agreement and conditions to your license.  You must not do anything with this software that triggers a rule that you cannot or will not follow.

<!-- Because the license puts significant obligations on the licensee, we need to dispel confusion about legal characterization and remedies. To head off wasteful arguments in uncharted legal territory, expressly recite both contract and license.  The terms alone cannot establish contract. But in the likely event that facts do, clarify the consequences. -->

<!-- The final sentence goes to impossibility and frustration.  It may not be necessary, but we'd all better avoid the argument. -->

## Copyright

Each contributor licenses you to do everything with this software that would otherwise infringe that contributor's copyright in it.

<!-- Identical to the Copyright section of the Blue Oak Model License 1.0.0 -->

## Notices

You must ensure that everyone who gets a copy of any part of this software from you, with or without changes, also gets the text of this license or a link to <https://apicopyleft.com/license/{version}>.

<!-- Derived from to the Copyright section of the Blue Oak Model License 1.0.0 -->

## Patent

Each contributor licenses you to do everything with this software that would otherwise infringe any patent claims they can license or become able to license.

<!-- Identical to the Patent section of the Blue Oak Model License 1.0.0 -->

<!-- Note that Contributing requires a strong patent grant. -->

## Reliability

No contributor can revoke this license.

<!-- Identical to the Reliability section of the Blue Oak Model License 1.0.0 -->

<!-- Express irrevocability.  Note that headings are _not_ disclaimed, and Reliance evokes the relevant legal concept. -->

## Copyleft

With two exceptions, [Prototypes](#prototypes) and [Applications](#applications), you must contribute all changes and additions to this software, as well as all software that invokes this software's functionality, according to [Contributing](#contributing).

<!-- Compare MongoDB's statements on AGPLv3 https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/the-agpl and SSPLv1 https://www.mongodb.com/licensing/server-side-public-license/faq#implications -->

## Prototypes

The purpose of this exception to [Copyleft](#copyleft) is to allow private experimentation.

You need not contribute prototype changes, extensions, or applications that you do not end up using for more than fourteen calendar days, share with anyone else, or use to provide a service to anyone else.

<!-- See https://github.com/kemitchell/shared-component-license/issues/15 -->

## Applications

The purpose of this exception to [Copyleft](#copyleft) is to encourage cooperative development of this software, and to prohibit use of this software to create competing, proprietary substitutes for this software.

You need not contribute software that only invokes this software's functionality through the interfaces this software exposes, without exposing this software's interfaces and functionality to other software.

Interfaces exposed by this software include all the interfaces this software provides users or other software to invoke its functionality, such as command line, graphical, application programming, remote procedure call, and inter-process communication interfaces.

## Contributing

When this license requires you to contribute software:

<!-- This language functions like a defined term, without falling back on lawyerly conventions that alienate non-lawyer readers. -->

First, publish all source code for that software, in the preferred form for making changes, through a freely accessible distribution system widely used for similar source code, so the developer and others can find and copy it.

<!-- FSF has objected to licenses that require sending code back to the licensor specifically. -->

<!-- On criterion 10 of the Open Source Definition, see https://writing.kemitchell.com/2018/11/05/OSD-Copyleft-Regulation.html#technology-neutrality -->

Second, ensure that each part of that source code is licensed to the public under one of these:

1.  [The BSD-2-Clause Plus Patent License](https://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause-Patent.html)

2.  [The Blue Oak Model License 1.0.0](https://spdx.org/licenses/BlueOak-1.0.0.html)

3.  terms with substantially the same legal effect as [Copyright](#copyright), [Patent](#patent), and [Reliability](#reliability), and optionally a rule like [Notices](#notices), a disclaimer like [No Liability](#no-liability), or both, but no other terms

4.  this license

<!-- Note that criterion 3 of the Open Source Definition requires permitting licensing on the same terms: https://writing.kemitchell.com/2018/11/05/OSD-Copyleft-Regulation.html#allow-the-same-terms-for-derived-works -->

<!-- Note that BSD-2-Clause-Patent's patent grant follows Apache 2.0's approach to scope. -->

Note that this license does _not_ allow you to change the license terms for this software, but only to contribute software covered by [Copyleft](#copyleft) under terms from the list above.

Take these steps within thirty calendar days of creating or using the software for the first time.

## Excuse

If anyone notifies you in writing that you have not complied with [Notices](#notices) or [Copyleft](#copyleft), you can keep your license by taking all practical steps to comply within 30 days after the notice.  If you do not do so, your license ends immediately.

## No Liability

***As far as the law allows, this software comes as is, without any warranty or condition, and no contributor will be liable to anyone for any damages related to this software or this license, under any kind of legal claim.***

<!-- Plain text renderings of the license should use symbols, like asterisks, rather than ALL CAPS, for conspicuity. -->
