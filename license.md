# API Copyleft License Development Draft

## Purpose

<!-- See https://writing.kemitchell.com/2019/01/10/Discipline-Stated-Purpose.html -->

This license allows you to use and share this software for free, but you have to share improvements to it, as opposed to applications, alike.

## Agreement

In order to receive this license, you have to agree to its rules.  Those rules are both obligations under that agreement and conditions to your license.  Don't do anything with this software that triggers a rule you can't or won't follow.

<!-- Because the license puts significant obligations on the licensee, we need to dispel confusion about legal characterization and remedies. To head off wasteful arguments in uncharted legal territory, expressly recite both contract and license.  The terms alone can't establish contract. But in the likely event that facts do, clarify the consequences. -->

<!-- The final sentence goes to impossibility and frustration.  It may not be necessary, but we'd all better avoid the argument. -->

## Copyright

Each contributor licenses you to do everything with this software that would otherwise infringe that contributor's copyright in it.

<!-- Identical to the Copyright section of the Blue Oak Model License 1.0.0 -->

## Notices

Make sure everyone who gets a copy of any part of this software from you, with or without changes, also gets the text of this license or a link to <https://apicopyleft.com/license/{version}>.

<!-- Derived from to the Copyright section of the Blue Oak Model License 1.0.0 -->

## Patent

Each contributor licenses you to do everything with this software that would otherwise infringe any patent claims they can license or become able to license.

<!-- Identical to the Patent section of the Blue Oak Model License 1.0.0 -->

<!-- Note that Contributing requires a strong patent grant. -->

## Reliability

No contributor can revoke this license.

<!-- Express irrevocability.  Note that headings are _not_ disclaimed, and Reliance evokes the relevant legal concept. -->
